# Computational Tools Workshop 2026

This is a repository containing the materials for the workshop "Computational Tools for Measuring 
Diversity, Agreement, and Polarization" put together by the Data and Democracy Research Initiative
at the university of Chicago in February 2026.

## Promotional Blurb

Join us for a hands-on workshop in which Piotr Faliszewski (Professor of Computer Science, AGH 
University of Science and Technology) and Stanislaw Szufa (Postdoc at CNRS, LAMSADE, Université 
Paris Dauphine-PSL) will give a self-contained introduction to modeling and measurement in 
(computational) social choice theory. The presentation will include ideas about simulating ranked 
elections, offering a “map of elections” showing similarity and dissimilarity of generative models. 
The computational tools enable research on the level of diversity, agreement, and polarization in 
a ranked election. Participants are invited to come with a laptop and be ready to learn hands-on 
skills!
